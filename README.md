Extend Swarm PRM by adding space-time macro planning

Swarm CVT implementation based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02510
## Intuition

if the next GMM in state does not have enough capacity, agent would need to split to smaller groups to guarantee traversability. Therefore some agents need to wait before some other agents.
