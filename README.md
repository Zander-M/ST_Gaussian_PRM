Extend Swarm PRM by adding space-time macro planning

## Intuition

if the next GMM in state does not have enough capacity, agent would need to split to smaller groups to guarantee traversability. Therefore some agents need to wait before some other agents.

## Steps

construct Gaussian Maps, with varying variance?

* use this idea for diffusion?
