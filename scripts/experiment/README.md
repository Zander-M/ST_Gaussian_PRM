# Experiments

## Static Experiments

Swarm planning in static environment. We compare with SwarmPRM for quantitative results. 

Metrics:
* Solution Time: time taken to find a solution
* Success Rate: solution that respects the capacity constraint over all experiments
* Relative Makespan/Transport Cost: relative performance as a ratio between the solution found by ST-Gaussian-PRM and SwarmPRM
